# Debugging

> If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
> - [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)

Software Development is a many layered skill. One simple way to break it down is to think of these layers:

1. **Source Code**: _The basic literacy of programming_
    - Learning the key words (_vocabulary_) and syntax (_grammar_) for your programming language
    - Being able to read your code out loud, or write the code that someone else is describing
    - Fixing syntax errors that occur when you try to run your code
    - Writing code that does not have syntax errors, and spotting syntax errors when you do
    - > _The **Debugging** Module will focus on these skills_
1. **Machine Instructions**: _The basic mechanics of programming_
    - Understanding the life-cycle of your program
    - Understand how the computer will interpret your source code to create a running program
    - Understand what about your code matters to the computer, and what matters to people
    - Predicting which lines of code will be executed in which order
    - Predicting how each line of code will change what is stored in program memory
    - Reading error messages & callstacks to fix fix semantic errors that occur when you run your code
    - > _The **Debugging** Module will focus on these skills_
1. **Problem Solving & Algorithms**: _Breaking down large problems to be solved in small steps_
    - Understanding a coding challenge and being able to break it down in different ways
    - Determining which solution strategies are correct for which types of problems
    - Understanding how test cases are used to describe your solution strategy
    - Identifying the best language feature to use with your strategy
    - Reading test cases to understand how code is _supposed to_ behave
    - Using Test Cases to structure your solution design process (Test Driven Development)
    - Identifying and isolating mistakes in your code by reading failing test cases
    - Demonstrating your code does what you think it does by passing test cases
    - > _The **Problem Solving** Module will focus on these skills_
1. **Software Design**: _Organizing smaller pieces of code into full software solutions_
    - All in good time ;)
    - > _Every module starting with **Separation of Concerns** will focus on these skills_

## Learning Objectives

What can you expect to learn in this module?

<details>
<summary>expand/collapse</summary>


### Programming Skills

- [Learning from Code](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code)
  - Reading & understanding source code
  - Making small, incremental experiments
  - Copying & modifying others' code
- Tracing Program Execution
  - Stepping through code with JS Tutor, DevTools & VSC debugger
  - Tracing values manually with pencil & paper
  - Using the `debugger` statement & break points to explore your code
- Using `console.assert` for small inline tests
  - Learn to _predict_ what _will happen_ using `console.assert`
  - Instead of only _describing_ what _did happen_ using `console.log`
- Debugging:
  - Bugs are when you don't understand what your code is doing, not when your code doesn't understand what you want it to do!  The computer is always right :)
  - Identify the line(s) of code that are not doing what you expect
  - Find several other ways of writing that line
  - Replace with the one that works and that you understand best
- Errors:
  - _Syntax vs. Semantic_: Some errors happen because you wrote JavaScript that the interpreter couldn't interpret (syntax), other errors happen when you try to do something that isn't allowed (semantic).
  - _Creation vs. Execution_: Some errors are thrown before the program actually becomes a process (creation phase), others are thrown during program execution when a line of code is reached (execution phase).

### Isolating JavaScript

- Primitives Types & Strict Comparison
  - _types_: find the type of a primitive using `typeof`
  - _strict comparison_: compare the type _and_ value of two primitives using `===` & `!==`
  - _explicit coercion_: casting between primitive types
- Explicit Type Coercion
  - `Boolean`, `String`, `Number`
- Operators & Comparisons
  - `===`, `!==`
  - `isNaN` and `Number.isNaN`
  - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
  - `&&`, `||`, `??`, `!`
  - `x++`, `++x`, `x--`, `--x`
  - `+`, `*`, `/`, `-`, `%`
  - `x ? y : z`
- Variables:
  - `let` & `const`
  - Declaration, Assignment & Re-Assignment.
  - Block Scope
- Functions
  - `() => {}`:
  - Declaring vs. Calling
  - Arguments vs. Parameters
  - Return Values
  - Lexical scope
- Control Flow
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
- `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm`
  - Validating user input
  - Providing helpful feedback

### Debugging Skills

- `console.log`
  - Printing values to understand what _did_ happen in your code
  - _Always print the **type** AND the **value**_
- `console.assert`
  - Asserting values to _predict_ what will happen in your code
  - Practice how to use all comparison operators to assert values in memory
- Stepping through code execution
  - Using debugging tools to execute your code one step at a time
  - Predict which line of code will execute next
  - Explain and understand how each line of code changes what is in memory
  - Predict what will change in memory after each step of execution
- The `debugger` statement
- Using professional JS debugging tools
  - Browser Debugger
  - VSCode Debugger
- Using learning-focused debugging tools
  - JS Tutor

### JS Program Life-Cycle:

1. _Source code_: The `.js` text file you write.  These are just instructions saved as text in your computer, not a live process (a process is an active instance of a program)!
2. _Creation Phase_: When the JavaScript interpreter first reads your instructions from the program.  At this point it will load the program into memory (thus making a process) and check for some types of errors.
3. _Execution Phase_: This is the real deal! The JavaScript interpreter will now step through your instructions _one line at a time_, updating the (process) memory according to your instructions.

### Integrating JavaScript

- Document Life-Cycle
  - `<head>`: Scripts & styles are loaded top to bottom, before the `<body>`
  - `<body>`: Everything is executed/loaded top to bottom
- Event-Driven Programming (Handling user input)
  - HTML `onclick` attribute
  - well-organized source files

### Code in this repo

- **[a-isolate](./a-isolate)**: Practice the foundations of JavaScript in isolation. Learn to step through and predicting your program's execution using the _debugger_ and _JS Tutor_. These examples and exercises have no user input and have no HTML/CSS.
- **[b-interact](./b-interact)**: Learn to work with _primitive types_ and _control flow_ by writing interactive scripts. Code in this folder uses `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm` for handling user interactions.
- **[c-integrate](./c-integrate)**: Learn how to write your JavaScript in an HTML file using `<script>` tags.  Add `on_something_` attributes to your DOM elements so users can trigger your scripts by taking different actions.
- **[d-separate](./d-separate)**: Bring it all together! Learn to write full projects using HTML, CSS & JS stored in separate files.  You will learn to organize your code into a folder structure and to load your scripts using the `<script src="./folder/file.js">` syntax
